Wee Teng Ren FED Project:

My project is the creation of a fictional tavel blog website called "wanderly" which is designed to show travellers different kinds of travel itineries, places to travel and tips to allow them to have an easier time while travelling. The ultimate goal of this website is to mainly help first time travellers as the content is mainly the experience of a experienced traveller "teng ren" and he shares his experience and places that he like to travel in his free time, he also recommends places for travellers to go allowing first time travellers or travellers in general, have an idea of what to expect. "teng ren" also offers a tour service where you can sign up and travel places around with him as your tour guide, ultimately making it a perfect website for first time travellers.

The way I decided to design this website is with the idea of helping travellers in general. Firstly, to make the readers piqued about the idea of travelling, I decided to show a picture of a populat tourist destination, which would most likely make the readers be curious about of. I then added a page for the owner "teng ren" to prove his credibility of travel. Furthermore, I added the travel itinerary page which showcases the popular destinations and links to the travel itinerary that "teng ren" has used for his travel. Since there are beautiful pictures of the location on the pictures of the travel itinerary, the readers would most likely be intrigued and click on them, leading to the itinerary which would make them excited as they would be thinking of the other gorgeous locations they can visit. Finally, should they want to visit, if firstly they feel unsure, there would be a travel tips page to ensure them of what they can do. Next, after they decided that they truly want to go overseas, they can book with the owner "teng ren" to go on a trip overseas. If they still have doubts when on the booking page, there would be more pictures of the popular destinations, further encouraging them to book with "teng ren"
